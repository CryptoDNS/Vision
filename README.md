# AlchemyProtocol for a CryptoDNS Analogue

## Vision
An Autonomous Systems Architecture for a New Financial System! "Hybrid Exchange" running of a Root Zone per Cryptocurrency, and Root-of-Trust - Enables Coins to Audit the DEX &amp; CEXs they're Traded on! A "Pull" based Information Flow.

## Regions
Within the entire CryptoDNS we have Diffrent "Types" of Blockchain Assets called Regions: work like Regional-Internet-Registries! Which share Similar Assets!
- Stablecoins
- Floating Rate Coins
- NFT Tokens
- Smart Contract Platforms

## Crypto Root Zones
Coin Root Zones work like a single Top Level Domain! Each Region issues one "Zone" per Crypto project or initiative.
This zone is the master process of the assets Blockchain!

## Charters
To get in the CryptoDNS System your institution or organization must go through a Chartering process, and agree to Self Regulate!


## Resolving & "Caching" Servers
A Crypto Zone can distribute work to multiple Resolvers, which work do Resolution & Auditing to different Institutions Centralized & Decentralized exchanges. This works very similar to caching DNS Resolvers operated by ISPs.

# Domainservers
This are actual Serverless code which runs on different blockchain VMs, and can relay network traffic commands to other nodes on the CryptoDNS Hierarchy! Their main function is to Perform a Clearinghouse Function, Verify smart contract are valid & Safe BEFORE they execute, and most importantly: Issue Autonomious "Audits as Code" to institutions chartered to use each Crypto!

## Autonomous Audits "Audits as Code"
github.com/CryptoDNS/Audits-as-Code is a way to Replace Human Regulators with an A.I., that close to Sentient enough to fully maintain the Integrity & Safety of the system! Better than a Human Coud, With NO mistakes!

## Querying
Is the process of sending get or set or method RPCs up the entire tree! From the Leaves / Zones to the Top of the Tree!
